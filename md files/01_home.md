## Who We Work With

We work with:
- Pre-seed and seed-stage startups
- Mobility, EV, automotive, logistics, and smart transportation teams
- Founders connected to MobilityXlab
- Teams that want speed without burning capital

If you already have product-market fit and a large internal team, we may not be the right fit.

## Our Zero → One Execution Model

### 1. Competitor & Market Research
We analyze competitors, substitutes, and adjacent solutions to identify real gaps.

### 2. Product–Market Fit Validation
We validate the problem, the user, and the willingness to adopt.

### 3. Feature List Finalisation
We cut noise and define a lean, validation-focused feature set.

### 4. Design Partner Alignment
UX direction that supports decision-making, not decoration.

### 5. Development & Launch
Native mobile apps, web apps, and scalable systems built for production.

### 6. Lead Generation Setup
Early traction systems so your product doesn’t launch in isolation.

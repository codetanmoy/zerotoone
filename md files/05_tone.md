# Brand Tone & Voice

## Overall Tone

- Calm
- Direct
- Confident
- Respectful

## Writing Style

- Short sentences
- Clear claims
- No exaggeration
- No buzzword stacking

## What We Avoid

- “Disrupting everything”
- “World-class solutions”
- “Next-generation innovation”

## What We Say Instead

- What we do
- Who it’s for
- What outcome it creates

We speak like product builders, not marketers.
